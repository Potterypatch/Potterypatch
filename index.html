    <h2>About Pottery Patch</h2>
    <p>In 2024, we opened the doors to Oamaru’s first dedicated ceramic painting studio and café. What began as a dream to share our love of creativity has grown into a welcoming space where anyone can unwind, explore their artistic side, and make something truly personal.</p>
    <p>At Pottery Patch, we offer painting experiences for individuals and groups of all ages — from quiet solo afternoons with a cup of coffee to lively family sessions and birthday parties. Our friendly team is here to guide you through every step, whether you’re a first‑time painter or a seasoned ceramic artist. We believe in the joy of making things by hand and the power of art to bring people together. Come in, relax, and let your imagination take shape!</p>
